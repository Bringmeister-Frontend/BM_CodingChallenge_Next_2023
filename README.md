# Bringmeister Coding Challenge

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Install the dependencies with npm, then you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I also added some the hooks - `useGetCart` for retrieving fake cart data, and - `useGetProducts` for retrieving fake product data

Both include a delay to simulate network loading. Each hook returns an object
with the loading state as a boolean and the data if not loading finished

## Work to do:

-   Display a loading info while the products are in loading state;

-   Display a tile for each product with the following infos:

    -   Image (as image; you add also e.g.:"?imwidth=175" to the image url to get a 175px wide image, the size 175px is just an example and can be defined based on requirements)
    -   Name
    -   Base Price (formatted in German Currency format e.g. 1.2 will be "â‚¬1,20")
    -   Base Unit

-   In the grid the minimum tile width should be 300px with maximum 7 tiles in a row being displayed on screen.
-   The tiles should be displayed in a grid and as one column on screens below 480px.
-   The layout of the tiles and their content should be optimised for mobile view below 480px and optimised for desktop view above 480px.

-   Add a search input field on top that allows filtering the products that contain the input in the product name.

Bonus task:

-   use CSS Grid in the layout of tiles;
-   Add the count in cart (amount > 0) to the product tile (Note: You have
    to use the `sku` field to find the matching products)

### Evaluation points

-   Use of state management
-   Modular component design
-   DRY (Reusable code)
-   Rendering / Performance / Management of Component lifestyle
-   Strong typing and consistent use of Typescript
-   General knowledge of CSS and proper use of selector specificity
-   Mobile Responsiveness
-   Technical explanation of code
-   Good Test Coverage using Playwright
-   Web accessibility standards are followed
-   W3c Standards are followed

### Additional Information

-   Even though this project is fairly simple try to organize it like you would do for larger components.
-   Your solution should scale with your experience.
-   Be prepared to explain your solution and your code in 15 minutes presentation.

-   Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

_Good luck_
